## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Phase 1 (Planning):** Branch-based migration chosen over dual-write complexity - build v3.0 in separate branch, one-time cutover
- Phase 1 (Planning): Three new columns at end of sheet (Ocupado_Por, Fecha_Ocupacion, version) - safest position
- Phase 1 (Planning): Archive v2.1 tests, create 5-10 v3.0 smoke tests instead of running all 244 tests
- Phase 1 (Planning): 1-week rollback window after cutover before archiving v2.1
- Phase 1 (Planning): Hierarchical state machine (9 states, not 27) to prevent state explosion
- Phase 1 (Planning): Optimistic locking with version tokens for race condition prevention
- **Phase 1 (01-01):** Script-based migrations with idempotency for safe re-execution
- Phase 1 (01-01): Import V3_COLUMNS from config for single source of truth
- Phase 1 (01-01): Idempotency via column existence check (no migration version tracking)
- **Phase 1 (01-02):** Compatibility mode pattern for safe v2.1 → v3.0 migration
- Phase 1 (01-02): Default to v2.1 mode until migration complete (explicit opt-in to v3.0)
- Phase 1 (01-02): esta_ocupado as computed property (single source of truth from ocupado_por)
- **Phase 1 (01-03):** Archive v2.1 tests, create 28 focused v3.0 smoke tests (< 3 sec execution)
- Phase 1 (01-03): Use pytest.skip for migration-dependent tests (clear communication)
- Phase 1 (01-03): Test archival preserves historical knowledge without maintenance burden
- **Phase 1 (01-04):** 5-step migration process (backup, add columns, verify, init versions, smoke tests)
- Phase 1 (01-04): JSON checkpoint files for atomic operations with recovery
- Phase 1 (01-04): Sample-based verification (10 rows) for fast validation
- Phase 1 (01-04): 7-day rollback window balances safety and storage costs
- **Phase 1 (01-05):** Skip-based test organization for manual tests (clear distinction between CI-automated and manual)
- Phase 1 (01-05): Test harness dry-run mode prevents accidental sheet manipulation
- Phase 1 (01-05): Two-job CI pipeline (test-migration + smoke-tests) for parallel execution and fast feedback
- Phase 1 (01-05): psutil optional dependency with graceful skip for memory tests
- **Phase 1 (01-06-GAP):** Manual backup via Google Sheets UI when API storage quota is exceeded
- Phase 1 (01-06-GAP): 7-day rollback window balances safety with storage constraints
- Phase 1 (01-06-GAP): Verification via gspread API confirms backup integrity (row/column counts)
- **Phase 1 (01-07-GAP):** Sheet grid expansion before column addition (Google Sheets API enforces strict limits)
- Phase 1 (01-07-GAP): Production schema is 66 columns (63 v2.1 + 3 v3.0), not 68 as originally planned
- Phase 1 (01-07-GAP): Column positions 64-66 (1-indexed) for Ocupado_Por, Fecha_Ocupacion, version
- **Phase 1 (01-08a-GAP):** Fix verification script to use read_worksheet() instead of non-existent get_headers()/get_all_values()
- Phase 1 (01-08a-GAP): Skip empty rows in data integrity checks (292 valid rows with TAG_SPOOL)
- Phase 1 (01-08a-GAP): Migration coordinator executed with checkpoint recovery - all 6 verification checks passed
- **Phase 1 (01-08b-GAP):** Phase 1 marked complete with all 5 truths verified after gap closure
- Phase 1 (01-08b-GAP): Migration completion documentation includes rollback window expiration (2026-02-02)
- Phase 1 (01-08b-GAP): Production schema is 66 columns (63 v2.1 + 3 v3.0), confirmed and documented
- **Phase 2 (02-01):** 1-hour lock TTL balances long operations safety with preventing permanent locks
- Phase 2 (02-01): Lock token format "{worker_id}:{uuid4}" embeds identity + unique token for ownership verification
- Phase 2 (02-01): RedisRepository singleton pattern shares connection pool (max 50 connections) across all requests
- **Phase 2 (02-02):** Explicit 409 mapping in router endpoints for clear LOC-04 requirement compliance
- Phase 2 (02-02): Best-effort metadata logging - Redis lock + Sheets write are critical, metadata is audit only
- Phase 2 (02-02): Deferred Estado_Ocupacion column to future v3.0 schema enhancement
- **Phase 2 (02-03):** UUID4 version tokens chosen over sequential counters for global uniqueness
- Phase 2 (02-03): Max 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (100ms-10s range) balances success rate with load
- Phase 2 (02-03): Jittered backoff (±25%) prevents thundering herd during concurrent retries
- Phase 2 (02-03): Two-layer defense - Redis locks (primary) + version tokens (secondary) for data integrity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (COMPLETE):** ✅ All 9 plans executed, all 5 truths verified
- ✅ Gap 1 CLOSED: Production backup created (1kWUjegxV00MOJver_9ljZqHxgJJBgErnH_J--N4TS9M) - 7-day rollback window active until 2026-02-02
- ✅ Gap 2 CLOSED: v3.0 columns added to production sheet (66 columns: 63 v2.1 + 3 v3.0)
- ✅ Gap 3a CLOSED: Migration coordinator executed - 6/6 verification checks, 39/39 tests passed
- ✅ Gap 3b CLOSED: Migration documentation complete (MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md, 01-VERIFICATION.md updated)
- **Status:** Phase 1 complete

**Phase 2 (IN PROGRESS):** Core Location Tracking - 3/4 waves complete
- ✅ Wave 1: Redis infrastructure deployed (02-01: 3 min)
- ✅ Wave 2: OccupationService with TOMAR/PAUSAR/COMPLETAR (02-02: 5.5 min)
- ✅ Wave 3: Optimistic locking with version tokens (02-03: 4 min)
- ◆ Wave 4 next: Race condition tests + monitoring (02-04)
- **Gaps (deferred to future):**
  - FastAPI startup/shutdown events for Redis connection lifecycle
  - Redis health check endpoint for monitoring
  - Estado_Ocupacion column for paused state marking

**Phase 4 (Metrología):** Special case workflow requires research - instant COMPLETAR without occupation, how to handle in state machine (separate state machine or conditional guards)?

**Phase 5 (Reparación):** Manufacturing rework best practices need validation - typical max cycles, supervisor escalation rules, quality department workflows.
