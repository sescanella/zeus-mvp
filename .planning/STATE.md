# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-26)

**Core value:** Real-time visibility of spool occupation - See EN VIVO who is working on which spool
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Migration Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Migration Foundation)
Plan: 5 of 5 complete (01-05-PLAN.md) ✅ PHASE COMPLETE
Status: Complete - All Wave 3 plans complete
Last activity: 2026-01-26 — Completed 01-05: End-to-End Migration Verification Suite

Progress: [██████████] 100% (5 plans complete - Phase 1 COMPLETE)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 7 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.62 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01    | 5/5 ✅ | 37 min | 7 min    |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (9 min), 01-04 (13 min), 01-05 (5 min)
- Trend: Testing tasks faster than orchestration, Phase 1 complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Phase 1 (Planning):** Branch-based migration chosen over dual-write complexity - build v3.0 in separate branch, one-time cutover
- Phase 1 (Planning): Three new columns at end of sheet (Ocupado_Por, Fecha_Ocupacion, version) - safest position
- Phase 1 (Planning): Archive v2.1 tests, create 5-10 v3.0 smoke tests instead of running all 244 tests
- Phase 1 (Planning): 1-week rollback window after cutover before archiving v2.1
- Phase 1 (Planning): Hierarchical state machine (9 states, not 27) to prevent state explosion
- Phase 1 (Planning): Optimistic locking with version tokens for race condition prevention
- **Phase 1 (01-01):** Script-based migrations with idempotency for safe re-execution
- Phase 1 (01-01): Import V3_COLUMNS from config for single source of truth
- Phase 1 (01-01): Idempotency via column existence check (no migration version tracking)
- **Phase 1 (01-02):** Compatibility mode pattern for safe v2.1 → v3.0 migration
- Phase 1 (01-02): Default to v2.1 mode until migration complete (explicit opt-in to v3.0)
- Phase 1 (01-02): esta_ocupado as computed property (single source of truth from ocupado_por)
- **Phase 1 (01-03):** Archive v2.1 tests, create 28 focused v3.0 smoke tests (< 3 sec execution)
- Phase 1 (01-03): Use pytest.skip for migration-dependent tests (clear communication)
- Phase 1 (01-03): Test archival preserves historical knowledge without maintenance burden
- **Phase 1 (01-04):** 5-step migration process (backup, add columns, verify, init versions, smoke tests)
- Phase 1 (01-04): JSON checkpoint files for atomic operations with recovery
- Phase 1 (01-04): Sample-based verification (10 rows) for fast validation
- Phase 1 (01-04): 7-day rollback window balances safety and storage costs
- **Phase 1 (01-05):** Skip-based test organization for manual tests (clear distinction between CI-automated and manual)
- Phase 1 (01-05): Test harness dry-run mode prevents accidental sheet manipulation
- Phase 1 (01-05): Two-job CI pipeline (test-migration + smoke-tests) for parallel execution and fast feedback
- Phase 1 (01-05): psutil optional dependency with graceful skip for memory tests

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 (Metrología):** Special case workflow requires research - instant COMPLETAR without occupation, how to handle in state machine (separate state machine or conditional guards)?

**Phase 5 (Reparación):** Manufacturing rework best practices need validation - typical max cycles, supervisor escalation rules, quality department workflows.

**Phase 1 (01-04 - Minor):** Google Sheets API (gspread) doesn't support full sheet restoration or column deletion - rollback requires manual intervention for these steps. Not blocking - provides clear instructions.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-26
Stopped at: Completed 01-05-PLAN.md (End-to-End Migration Verification Suite) ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE
Resume file: None

**Next steps:**
1. ✅ Phase 1 (Migration Foundation) complete - all 5 plans executed successfully
2. 🎯 Proceed to Phase 2: State Machine Implementation
3. Phase 2 will implement 9-state hierarchical state machine for occupation management
