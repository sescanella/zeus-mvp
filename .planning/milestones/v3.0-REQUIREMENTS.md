## v3.0 Requirements

Requirements for v3.0 real-time location tracking system. All 24 requirements shipped and validated.

### Location Tracking

- [x] **LOC-01**: Worker can TOMAR available spool (occupation constraint enforced) — ✅ Shipped (Redis atomic locks, 1-hour TTL)
- [x] **LOC-02**: Worker can PAUSAR spool without completing (→ DISPONIBLE) — ✅ Shipped (releases lock, preserves progress)
- [x] **LOC-03**: Worker can COMPLETAR spool (finish + → DISPONIBLE) — ✅ Shipped (updates Sheets + releases lock)
- [x] **LOC-04**: System prevents 2 workers TOMAR same spool (race condition protection) — ✅ Shipped (validated with 10 concurrent tests)
- [x] **LOC-05**: Worker can see real-time list of DISPONIBLE spools (< 10s refresh) — ✅ Shipped (SSE streaming)
- [x] **LOC-06**: Worker can see real-time list of OCUPADO spools with owner — ✅ Shipped (Dashboard with EventSource)

### State Management

- [x] **STATE-01**: System displays combined state (occupation + ARM progress + SOLD progress) — ✅ Shipped (EstadoDetalleBuilder)
- [x] **STATE-02**: Metadata logs all TOMAR/PAUSAR/COMPLETAR events (audit trail) — ✅ Shipped (append-only Metadata sheet)
- [x] **STATE-03**: Estado_Detalle shows "Armando: Juan (93) - ARM parcial, SOLD pendiente" — ✅ Shipped (column 67)
- [x] **STATE-04**: System uses hierarchical state machine (< 15 states, not 27+) — ✅ Shipped (6 states: 3 ARM + 3 SOLD)

### Collaborative Work

- [x] **COLLAB-01**: Any worker with correct role can continue partially-completed work — ✅ Shipped (no strict ownership)
- [x] **COLLAB-02**: System enforces operation dependencies (SOLD requires ARM initiated) — ✅ Shipped (guard validators)
- [x] **COLLAB-03**: System tracks multiple workers on same spool sequentially — ✅ Shipped (Metadata sessions)
- [x] **COLLAB-04**: Worker can view occupation history per spool — ✅ Shipped (GET /api/history/{tag_spool})

### Metrología

- [x] **METRO-01**: Metrólogo can COMPLETAR with result (APROBADO / RECHAZADO) — ✅ Shipped (3-state machine)
- [x] **METRO-02**: Metrología workflow skips TOMAR (instant completion) — ✅ Shipped (no Redis lock)
- [x] **METRO-03**: RECHAZADO triggers estado "Pendiente reparación" — ✅ Shipped (EstadoDetalleBuilder)
- [x] **METRO-04**: Metrología requires ARM + SOLD both COMPLETADO — ✅ Shipped (prerequisite validation)

### Reparación

- [x] **REPAR-01**: Worker can TOMAR spool RECHAZADO for reparación — ✅ Shipped (ReparacionService, 4-state machine)
- [x] **REPAR-02**: Reparación specifies responsible role (Armador/Soldador) — ✅ Shipped (no role restriction pattern, OPERATION_TO_ROLES['REPARACION'] = [])
- [x] **REPAR-03**: COMPLETAR reparación returns spool to metrología queue — ✅ Shipped (Estado_Detalle="PENDIENTE_METROLOGIA")
- [x] **REPAR-04**: System limits reparación cycles (max 3 loops) — ✅ Shipped (CycleCounterService, BLOQUEADO after 3 rejections)

### Backward Compatibility

- [x] **BC-01**: v2.1 data migrates to v3.0 schema without loss — ✅ Shipped (66 columns: 63 v2.1 + 3 v3.0, 7-day rollback)
- [x] **BC-02**: 244 v2.1 tests pass before archiving and are preserved as reference — ✅ Shipped (233 tests archived to tests/v2.1-archive/)

- ✓ **V21-UI-02**: 7-page linear flow (Worker → Operation → Type → Spool → Confirm → Success) — v2.1
- ✓ **V21-UI-03**: Batch UI (multiselect with checkboxes, contador, select all) — v2.1

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded features with reasoning (unchanged from v3.0).

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Automatic PAUSAR on timeout** | Manual control only. Workers decide when to release spools. Automatic timeout could release mid-critical-operation. Adds complexity without clear value. |
| **GPS/RFID physical tracking** | Logical occupation (worker assignment) sufficient for manufacturing floor scale (30-50 workers). Physical sensors cost $50K+ (UWB/BLE infrastructure). Avoid hardware dependency. |
| **Sub-1-second real-time sync** | 5-10 second refresh sufficient for manufacturing floor (not warehouse picking). Google Sheets API limits (200-500ms latency) make sub-second impossible. Over-engineering. |
| **Reservation system** | No "reserve for later" without physically taking spool. Prevents inventory hoarding, ensures real physical state. Reservation adds ghost occupations. |
| **Multi-operation TOMAR** | Worker can only TOMAR for ONE operation at a time (ARM or SOLD, not both simultaneously). Prevents blocking other workers. Single-threaded work is manufacturing reality. |
| **Retroactive edits** | Metadata is append-only (no editing history). Regulatory requirement for audit trail integrity. Allow edits → enable fraud. |
| **Complex role hierarchies** | Flat role system (4 roles: Armador, Soldador, Metrología, Ayudante). No supervisor approval workflows, manager hierarchies, or delegated permissions in v3.0. Defer to v3.1+ if needed. |
| **Video/photo uploads** | Metrología result is binary (APROBADO/RECHAZADO). Photos for defect documentation defer to v3.1+. Adds storage complexity (Google Drive integration). |
| **Real-time chat/notifications** | Workers use physical proximity (manufacturing floor). No Slack-style chat or push notifications. Dashboard visibility sufficient. |
| **Mobile apps (iOS/Android)** | Web-first on tablets. Native apps defer to v4.0+. PWA sufficient for offline capability if needed later. |
| **Advanced analytics/dashboards** | Basic "who has what" dashboard only. BI dashboards (productivity metrics, bottleneck analysis, cycle time) defer to v3.1+. Focus on operational visibility first. |
